# :.Sum.:
__Sira🍋__ is a proof-of-concept sprite combiner, made to bring trainercards concept from _Pokémon_ series to [Siralim 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/841770/Siralim_3/).  
Initially started as quick experiment, it was developed to prove usiability of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) combination.

# :.Reassembling.:
__Sira🍋__ was developed in [CoffeeScript v2](https://coffeescript.org/) with tiny [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) bootstrap.  
It requires .NET 4.5 framework and latest [node-clr](https://github.com/AtsushiSuzuki/node-clr) by AtsushiSuzuki.  
__Memo:__ use `npm i "git://github.com/AtsushiSuzuki/node-clr.git#f6ff21b5938a794267597390d8d1fbb22a77fd02"` to build `node-clr` for NodeJS >9.
