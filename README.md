# :.Sum.:
__Siraüçã__ is a proof-of-concept sprite combiner, made to bring trainercards concept from _Pok√©mon_ series to [Siralim 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/841770/Siralim_3/).  
Initially started as quick experiment, it was developed to prove usiability of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) combination.

# :.Reassembling.:
__Siraüçã__ was developed in [CoffeeScript v2](https://coffeescript.org/) with tiny [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) bootstrap, which can be built by sript provided in `src\release.cmd`.  
It requires .NET 4.5 framework and latest [node-clr](https://github.com/AtsushiSuzuki/node-clr) by AtsushiSuzuki to run.
