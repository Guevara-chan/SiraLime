# :.Sum.:
__Siraüçã__ is a proof-of-concept sprite combiner, made to bring trainercards concept from _Pok√©mon_ series to [Siralim 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/841770/Siralim_3/).  
Initially started as quick experiment, it was developed to prove useability of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) integration.  
__Latest version:__ https://github.com/Guevara-chan/SiraLime/releases/download/0.56/SiraLime.zip (direct link)  
__Sprite cache:__ https://github.com/Guevara-chan/SiraLime/releases/download/res/res.zip (direct link, not required)

# :.Featur√¶.:
* Seamless integration: just pick `Options->Export Character/Creature Data` in S3 and run SiraLime.exe to render card.
* All 792 creature sprites directly from developer (can optionally be downloaded for faster access).
* Proves (at least some) future for desktop JS/CS/TS development outside of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).


# :.Reassembling.:
__Siraüçã__ was developed in [CoffeeScript v2](https://coffeescript.org/) with tiny [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) bootstrap, which can be built by script provided in `src\release.cmd`  
It requires .NET 4.5 framework, [NodeJS 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (which goes to `bin` subdir) and latest [node-clr](https://github.com/AtsushiSuzuki/node-clr) by AtsushiSuzuki to run.
